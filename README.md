### Kernel Mode Driver - Memory Read/Write 

This project is a Windows kernel mode driver designed to enable reading and writing to the memory of a specified process. It is commonly used in scenarios such as game cheats where memory access to another process is required. However, note that using this driver to cheat in games or for any malicious purpose can result in bans and legal consequences. Use it for educational purposes only.

### Features 
  - Attach to a target process by its PID (Process ID).
  - Read memory from the target process.
  - Write memory to the target process.
  - Communication between user mode and kernel mode via IOCTL calls.
  - Basic debugging capabilities via kernel debug prints.

### Requirements 

  - # Windows Development Kit (WDK) #: Required to build and develop Windows drivers.
  - # Visual Studio #: Preferred IDE for driver development. Make sure to install the WDK components.
  - # Proper System Configuration #: Ensure your system is configured to allow unsigned drivers (for testing) or sign your driver with a valid certificate.
